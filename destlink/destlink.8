.SS NAME

destlink - A kanrisha service to provide a standardized interface for
disk locations
.SS SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]destlink\f[R]
.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[I]destlink\f[R] is a simple service that provides an easy way to link
standardized virtual paths with the actual place on the filesystem where
the user wants there files to reside.
This is useful if a package manager wants to install files that do not
have a universally standardized disk location or to just give the user
more power over where files actually are.
It is meant to be run as a service unit by the kanrisha service manager.

.PP
destlink.conf - destlink configuration file
.SS SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]/etc/kanrisha.d/available/destlink/destlink.conf\f[R]
.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[I]destlink.conf\f[R] file is read by destlink on service start
and specified every destination with interface name and path on the
filesystem.
It is executed by bash, so theoretically, all bash code could reside
within this file to allow for very fine-grained and customized
configuration of destinations based on current system state.
.PD 0

By default, the file sets a $USERNAME variable which specifies the
username of the user with uid 1000.
This can be used on single-user systems to fetch the home directory,
fuse(4) mountpoints, etc..
.PD 0

The actual destinations are specified as one variable per destination,
with their contents following the format \f[C]scope/name:path\f[R].

Valid scopes are system and user.
In this implementation, scopes are arbitrary, but this shouldn\[cq]t be
counted on.
The path MUST start with /, relative paths are NOT ALLOWED and could
even pose a security risk on some systems.
.PD 0

There must be a variable called \f[B]MOUNTS\f[R].
This variable provides a space-separated list of destination variable
names.
